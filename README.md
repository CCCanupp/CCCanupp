**CCCanupp/CCCanupp** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a python code and SQL database to webcrawl ETDs for research databases!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unix code on linux servers!
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on code to aid cybersecurity defense systems!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Java coding errors!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to paint in my freetime!
